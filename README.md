# linkchecking_a_repo
Trying to figure out how to automatically test if all links in a repos docs are live.

Doing this to aid [the turing way project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way). Additional information on this project can be found [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-handbook-reproducible-data-science).
